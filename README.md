# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid network topology
using Bus, Star, and Ring topologies created with Scilab and the NARVAL toolbox.

## Tools Used
- Scilab
- NARVAL (Network Analysis and Routing eVALuation)

## Files
- hybrid.sce : Scilab code for hybrid topology
- Hybrid_Topology_Report.docx : Project report
- screenshots/ : Output screenshots

## Description
The project demonstrates the creation, visualization, and analysis
of a hybrid network topology with a minimum of 25 nodes.
